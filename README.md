This course is described as being updated for iOS 8 and Swift. It covers the tools and APIs required to build applications for the iPhone and iPad platforms using the iOS SDK. User interface design for mobile devices and unique user interactions using multi-touch technologies. Object-oriented design using model-view-controller paradigm, memory management, and the Swift programming language. Other topics covered include animation, mobile device power management, multi-threading, network, and performance considerations.
